# Roman Rampage - MVP Development Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the development plan for creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version of "Roman Rampage," a browser-based top-down action-adventure game set in the Roman Empire. The MVP will focus on delivering core gameplay mechanics, essential features, and enough content to demonstrate the game concept and provide 30-60 minutes of engaging gameplay.

## Development Approach

- **Engine**: three.js for 3D rendering and basic physics
- **Development Environment**: next.js 15 with modern TypeScript
- **Testing**: Manual testing with Chrome DevTools for performance analysis

## Phase 1: Technical Foundation & Core Mechanics

### Project Setup & Basic Systems

- **Project Scaffolding**
  - Initialize project repository and dependency management using `pnpm`
  - Set up three.js environment with basic rendering pipeline
  - Create development and build workflows
  - Implement basic asset loading system

- **Player Character & Controls**
  - Implement character model and animation system
  - Develop smooth top-down camera system with zoom and rotation
  - Create responsive player movement controls
  - Set up collision detection system
  - Implement basic physics for character movement

### Core Game Systems

- **Game Environment & Level Structure**
  - Create a simple Roman environment with basic buildings and roads
  - Implement day/night cycle with lighting changes
  - Set up level boundaries and loading system
  - Add basic NPC placement system

- **Basic Gameplay Loop**
  - Implement score tracking system
  - Create wanted level mechanics with visual indicators
  - Develop basic AI for Roman authorities (pursuit and attack)
  - Set up game state management (main menu, playing, game over)
  - Implement basic HUD with score and wanted level

## Phase 2: Essential Game Features

### Vehicles & Combat

- **Vehicle System**
  - Create 2-3 basic vehicle types (chariot, cart)
  - Implement vehicle physics and handling
  - Develop vehicle entry/exit mechanics
  - Add vehicle damage system
  - Implement basic vehicle AI for traffic

- **Combat & Destruction**
  - Create basic combat mechanics (melee attacks)
  - Implement destructible objects (stalls, barrels, etc.)
  - Add sound effects for combat and destruction
  - Implement basic particle effects for destruction

### Mission System

- **Mission Framework**
  - Develop mission state management system
  - Create mission trigger points in the environment
  - Implement 3 difficulty levels with different requirements
  - Set up mission reward system (money, respect, multiplier)
  - Create mission UI elements (acceptance, objectives, completion)

- **Basic Missions**
  - Implement 5-7 mission templates (delivery, destruction, chase, etc.)
  - Create mission scripting system for event sequences
  - Add mission-specific dialogue system
  - Implement mission failure conditions and handling

## Phase 3: Content & Polish

### Game Content

- **Level Expansion**
  - Expand the initial level with more detailed areas
  - Add environmental variety (marketplace, villa district, forum)
  - Implement more complex NPC behaviors and routines
  - Add ambient sound effects and background music

- **Mission Content**
  - Create 10 unique missions using the mission templates
  - Balance mission difficulty and rewards
  - Implement progression gating based on score/respect
  - Add mission-specific assets and elements

### Performance Optimization & MVP Polish

- **Performance Optimization**
  - Implement level of detail (LOD) system for models
  - Optimize rendering pipeline and asset loading
  - Add object pooling for common entities
  - Implement occlusion culling for complex scenes

- **UI Polish & Player Feedback**
  - Refine UI elements for better usability
  - Add visual feedback for player actions
  - Implement tutorial tips and help system
  - Create scoring and reward animations

- **Day 5: Final MVP Integration**
  - Ensure all systems work together cohesively
  - Fix critical bugs and issues
  - Prepare for initial playtest
  - Create build pipeline for deployment

## Technical Considerations

### Three.js Implementation

- Use `InstancedMesh` for rendering numerous similar objects (buildings, props)
- Implement custom shaders for lighting effects (torches, time of day)
- Utilize `AnimationMixer` for character and vehicle animations
- Consider using `EffectComposer` for post-processing effects but be mindful of performance

### Performance Optimization

- Target 60 FPS on mid-range hardware
- Implement asset streaming to reduce initial load time
- Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Implement distance-based LOD and animation updates
- Consider using Web Workers for physics calculations if necessary

### Browser Compatibility

- Focus primarily on Chrome/Firefox/Edge compatibility
- Use feature detection rather than browser detection
- Implement fallbacks for non-WebGL2 browsers
- Provide clear minimum requirements messaging

## Testing Milestones

### Milestone 1: Core Mechanics (End of Week 2)

- Player movement and camera controls feel responsive
- Basic environment navigation works correctly
- Collision detection is reliable
- Core game loop can be demonstrated

### Milestone 2: Feature Complete (End of Week 4)

- Vehicle system functions properly
- Mission system can be demonstrated end-to-end
- Wanted system correctly escalates and responds to player actions
- Game states transition correctly

### Milestone 3: MVP Release Candidate (End of Week 6)

- All planned missions are implemented and playable
- Performance meets target requirements
- No critical bugs or blockers
- Complete gameplay loop can be demonstrated

## Post-MVP Considerations (Future Development)

- Additional levels and environments
- More vehicle types and customization
- Advanced wanted system with bribes and hideouts
- Expanded mission types and faction relationships
- Persistent progression system
- Audio improvements and voice acting
